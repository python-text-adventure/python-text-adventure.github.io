	<h1>What is Recursion?</h1>
	<p>Recursion is a form of repetition based on function calls, instead of loops. It is a type of function that calls itself or self-references.</p>
	<blockquote>Recursion is a form of repetition that uses function calls instead of loops. A recursive function is a function which contains one or more calls to itself. This allows for repetition of the instructions in the recursive function. One should not find this type of self-reference disconcerting. It’s not much different from a self-referencing definition like “the sum of n numbers is equal to the sum of the first n-1 numbers added to the last number”, which defines a sum in terms of another sum. In any case, it is this notion of self-reference that makes a function recursive. Functions that do not call themselves are non-recursive. (Introduction to Computer Science, Eramian, 115)</blockquote>
<p>
Simply put, a recursive function is a function that calls itself. Most of the time self-referencing functions would cause an infitite loop, but if coded properly, we can use recursive functions to perform repetitive tasks. For example, we can use a recursive function to find a factorial,</p>
<p>n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2)*...*3*2*1</p>
