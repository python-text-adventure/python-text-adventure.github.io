	<h1>Practice Problems</h1>
<p>You will not be expected to code your own recursive functions, but you will be expected to completed written recursive functions. For example,</p>
	<p><img src="images/ex1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
	<p><img src="images/ex2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
	<p><img src="images/ex3.jpg" alt=""/></p>
	<p><img src="images/ex4.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p><img src="images/ex5.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>Example 6<br>
	Depending on whether its egg is fertilized or not, a bee is born female (fertilized egg) or male (unfertilized egg). This means:<br>
• every male bee has a mother, but not a father<br>
• every female bee has a mother and a father<br>
Write a recursive function with an integer parameter N that returns the number of ancestors a male bee has at its Nth generation of ancestors.

	<p>We've seen this pattern before! It is a <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/fibonacci-sequence.html" target="new">Fibonacci Sequence</a>! It is a number created by adding the previous two numbers in the sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...</p>
