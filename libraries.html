<p>
Python is a modular programming language which means that some classes, functions, keywords,
and methods are built-in but others are imported when needed. Many modules need to
be installed on your computer to work, but the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/" target="new">
Python Standard Library</a> is a set of modules included with every Python installation.
You can use any class of function in the standard library by putting an import
statement at the top of your Python file.
</p>
<p>Let's revisit some examples that use the Python Standard Library. The following is
an example that uses the sys module so we can quit the game:</p>
<div>

</div>
<p>You'll notice on line 33 that there is sys.exit(). Calling something from a module is in the
form
</p>
<blockquote>[module name].[module function]</blockquote>
<p>For the randomized map, I used the function choice from the random module in lines 19, 20 and 29:</p>
<div>

    <iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python3/89299ef827" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

</div>
<p>Using Trinket, they have <a href="https://trinket.io/docs/python" target="new">a list of modules </a>
    outside the Python Standard Library and you are not able to install anymore. If you want a module that is not
    included in Trinket, you are better off using an installed version of Python on a computer or a  website
    like <a href="https://replit.com/" target="new">Repl.it</a>. Consider the random map example again in Replit
    formatted using the module tabulate.
</p>
<div class="linkContainer">
<iframe frameborder="0" width="100%" height="1600px" src="https://replit.com/@janicecotcher/randomheromap?lite=true"></iframe>
</div>
<p>The maps are nicely formatted into rows and columns using the tabulate module. You will notice that the import statement
is a little different. This time it is
</p>
<blockquote>from tabulate import tabulate</blockquote>
<p>If you have ever used Processing in Trinket, you may recognize the import statement</p>
<div>
<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/b3b4a66749" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<p>In this case the import statement has an asterisk (*) meaning that the entire module is imported and not just a part.
    We will learn more about import statements when we learn how to make our own modules in the next section.</p>
