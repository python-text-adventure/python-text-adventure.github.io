(a)	Investigate object-oriented programing concepts including classes, objects, attributes and methods.<br>
(c)	Design and implement a class, and create a program that utilizes instances of this class.<br>
(d)	Apply the principle of encapsulation through the creation and use of user-defined objects.<br>
(e)	Create a constructor and use it to instantiate an object.<br>
(f)	Compare object-oriented and procedural programming paradigms.</p>
<h2>Task 1: Create Classes</h2>
<p>Create classes for elements like inventory, player, obstacles, and map in separate files. Import and incorporate them into the game. At least one class must have a child class.
</p>
<p>
		For the map class and multidimensional arrays: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Add direction methods to the main game menu
  </li>
  <li>Add inventory and obstacles at various tiles  </li>
  <li>Add a start tile and a victory tile </li>
</ul>
<h2>Task 2: Organize the Classes</h2>
	<p>Create a sublist using a list comprehension from classes to sort the inventory. For example Items from healing, items for consuming, items for protection. Check if consumables are in the inventory and if the player uses them then the item is removed.
</p>
	<p>By the end of these two tasks, you will be very close to having a completely functional game. </p>
