      <h1>Appending an External File</h1>
      <p>Lesson partially adapted from “Python File Handling: How to Create Text File, Read, Write, Open, Append Files in Python.” Guru99, <a href="https://www.guru99.com/reading-and-writing-files-in-python.html" target = "new">www.guru99.com/reading-and-writing-files-in-python.html.</a> </p>
      <p>As you saw when you are writing to an external file, everytime you write, it overwrites what was previously there. What if you want to add to the file if you was looping through a items to be written? In that case you would use the append mode:</p>
<div class="linkContainer">
  <iframe frameborder="0" width="100%" height="1600px" src="https://replit.com/@janicecotcher/heroappend?lite=true"></iframe>
</div>
<p>The above program writes the name of the chosen hero then appends a list of all of their available inventory.</p>

         <a href="../index.html" class="home">Home</a>
         <a href="external_files.html" class="review">External Files</a>
      </div>
      </body>
      </html>
