   <h1>Assignment: Modules and Maps</h1>
	   
	   
   <p>Create a map for your game. Your map can be static (unchanging) or dynamic (changeable) and it can be created by using a nested list.This map must be written to an external file.  At this time, your map only needs to be printed out and you do not need movement within it.</p>
   <p>Organize your map, character, inventory, enemies, etc. into modules to import into the main game file. If you don't know here to begin with your map, check out the attached text.<br>
