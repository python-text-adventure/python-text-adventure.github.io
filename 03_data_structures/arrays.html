    <h1>Multiple Dimensional Lists</h1>
<p>We have looked at examples so far where the elements of lists or tuples are </p>
<ul>
<li>strings</li>
<li>integers</li>
<li>floating-points</li>
</ul>
<p>The elements of lists or tuples are not limited to the above, they can also be</p>
<ul>
<li>lists</li>
<li>tuples</li>
<li>dictionaries</li>
</ul>
<p>You can have lists inside of lists, tuples inside of tuples, tuples inside of lists, and so on.
     (We will deal with dictionaries within dictionaries in another section.)</p>
<p>A list within a list is sometimes called an <strong>array</strong>. Arrays are useful for
    creating grid-like maps for text-based adventure games. Consider the map for
    the game "Escape the Ship":</p>
<div>

</div>
<p>The map is a 3x3 grid created by putting 3 lists into each of the 3 outer lists. 
    Later we will learn how to define actions at each of those spots on the map.</p>
